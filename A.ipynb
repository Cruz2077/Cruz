    "Tumor cells were isolated and subjected to dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis, resulting in 16 clusters. These clusters were then merged based on their marker gene functions, yielding 7 tumor cell subgroups (Figure 3A). A bar plot displays the cell composition of each sample, showing that HCC samples have a higher content of APOA2+NEO cells, while CRLM samples have a higher content of TFF3+NEO cells. Differential gene expression analysis was performed for each subgroup, and a heatmap of differentially expressed genes was generated (Figure 3B). GO Biological Process (GOBP) enrichment analysis was conducted for the marker genes of each subgroup, revealing their corresponding functions. We compared the CNV differences among different cell types from different sample origins, finding significant differences in CNV across most cell types (Figure 3C). Transcription factor analysis was also performed for each cell type, with the results visualized in a heatmap showing different transcription factors enriched in various cell types (Figure 3D).\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequent cell trajectory analysis revealed multiple paths leading to different endpoints, indicating the potential existence of different subtypes. The starting branches contained a large number of APOA2+NEO cells and tumor cells from HCC (Figure 3E). From the pseudotime analysis, APOA2+NEO cells were primarily at the starting points, while most other cells were at the endpoints. Genes related to pseudotime were identified, and their expression heatmap was generated (Figure 3F). Scatter plots of pseudotime for six selected tumor marker genes (APOA2, HIST1H2AG, HMGB2, IGKV1-5, LCN2, TFF3) were created (Figure 3G).\n",
